======

This package serves as a reference implementation of a VMRC API
client. Its purpose is to demonstrate proper usage of the API methods
described in the "Using the VMRC API" Technical Note and provide
example code which simplifies the process of working with the VMRC API
in the context of vCloud Director 1.5.

Getting Started
---------------

0. If you do not have the VMRC Plugin installed, edit the line of
+index.html+ file which points to +example.com+ to reference the
vCD instance you wish to work with.

1. Open +index.html+ in a supported web browser.

2. Retrieve a screen ticket using the +acquireTicket+ vCD API call
on the VM you wish to connect to.

3. Enter the value of the screen ticket (which is of the form
+mks://hostname/moid?ticket=value+) into the form on +index.html+
and submit the form.

4. Wait for the popout console to load.

.Note
*****************************************************************
To integrate with the VMRC API, one would automate the process of
retrieving and passing the ticket, but that exact process would
depend on the technology being used for the backend of the portal
and is therefore omitted from this reference implementation.

Adapting the Reference Implementation
-------------------------------------

While it is expected that many components used in this reference
implementation could be reused without significant modification,
+vcd-console.js+ serves as an example of how to build a console
similar to the one present in vCD itself (including placeholders
for power state management buttons). To match the look and feel
of the portal that console functionality is being added to, the
+vcd-console.js+ file would need to be modified.
